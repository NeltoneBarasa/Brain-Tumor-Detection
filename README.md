# Brain-Tumor-Detection

This project focuses on the development of an automated brain tumor detection system using deep learning techniques, specifically designed to classify MRI images into various tumor categories. The primary objective is to create a robust model that can accurately identify and classify brain tumors such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumor from MRI scans. The system will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, taking advantage of the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CNNs to analyze complex patterns in MRI images, which is essential for diagnosing brain tumors.

The dataset used for training the model will consist of labeled MRI images, divided into training and testing datasets. The preprocessing steps will include image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve the model's performance and generalization. A variety of techniques such as data splitting, model evaluation, and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) will be used to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the system in real-world scenarios. The project aims to contribute to the healthcare field by providing an automated and efficient method for diagnosing brain tumors, reducing the dependency on human radiologists for initial screening.

By leveraging machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, the project will ensure scalability and adaptability to new datasets or potential real-time integration. The final model will be validated on a separate testing set to assess its generalization ability and will be compared against existing models to demonstrate its improvements in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The long-term goal is to make this automated detection system available for integration into medical workflows, thus assisting healthcare professionals in early tumor detection and treatment planning.
